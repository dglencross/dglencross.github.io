								<h2>About The Club</h2>
							</header>

							<p class="em">Highbury Jitsu Club was founded in 2005 after 4 years at the Roundhouse we have now relocated to Sotheby Mews Day Centre.</p>
<p class="i">Most students at Highbury joined the club without martial arts experience, and come from a variety of  different backgrounds. There is a good mixture of male and female students, and a wide age range from fifteen to forty something.</p>
		<p class="i">We are a not for profit and volunteer run club.</p>

										<h3>What type of Jujitsu is taught?</h3>
			<p>We are part of the <a href="http://www.jitsufoundation.org/">Jiu Jitsu Foundation</a> but teach and use techniques from other styles; Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Judo and Self Defence.</p>

								<h3>What is Jitsu?</h3>
										<p>Jitsu is derived from the feudal Japanese art of Jiu-Jitsu (also known as  Ju Jutsu). It is a practical and modern self-defense based martial art, incorporating joint locks, strikes and throws to deal with almost any attack imaginable. With a heavy emphasis on using an opponent's size and momentum against them, Jitsu is suitable for anyone; irrespective of age, strength, weight or gender. A history of our style can be found <a href ="http://www.jitsufoundation.org/faqs/what-is-jiu-jitsu-2/">here</a>.</p>
								        <p>Jitsu teaches moderated responses. An unjustified and unwanted grab does not warrant the same response as a   knife wielding mugger.</p>
									</article>
									<article class="item">
<h3>What are the Techniques?</h3>
										<p>Jiu-Jitsu incorporates many types of techniques. Techniques are taught at the level appropriate to the grade of the student.<br>
<li><strong>Strikes</strong> - How to strike someone for maximum effect.</li>
<li><strong>Locks</strong> - How to lock joints in order to restrain someone both standing and on the floor.</li>
<li><strong>Throws</strong> - Throws are used to send assailants crashing to the floor where they may be restrained.</li>
<li><strong>Defence from various unarmed attacks</strong> including wrist grabs, body grabs, punches, kicks and strangles</li>
<li><strong>Defence against various weapons</strong> - Knife, Cosh, Bottle, Chain, Broken Bottle, Sword,   etc.  At first, these are taught using rubber or wooden weapons. For senior grades   (purple belts and above), real weapons may be used.</li>
<li><strong>Defence against multiple attackers</strong> - Armed and unarmed, both standing up and also from a prone position</li>
<li><strong>Groundfighting</strong> - Techniques that will allow you to overcome a stronger or heavier opponent if the fight has been taken to the ground.</li>
<li><strong>BreakFalling</strong> - How to fall without injury. This is a major part of the syllabus.</li>
									</article>
									
									<article class="item">
										<h3>Progression</h3>
<p>As students become more experienced they can progress to a higher belts by attending a grading. Gradings are   held every 3 months and Sensei will announce details of the next one and   tell you when you are ready to take it. Each Grading is overseen by a   Sandan, usually from outside the Region, to promote impartiality.
<p>The general requirements for grading are:<p><strong><u>Lower Grades</u></strong></p>

									<article class="item">
<p>So, what can you expect when you first walk through the door?</p>
    <p>First of all, say hello! If you look slightly   lost, chances are that someone will ask if they can help you. If people   are already changed, look for a person wearing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HighburyJitsu/photos/a.426532184085811.98792.423082327764130/426532344085795/?type=3&theater">big black trousers</a>, or any Brown or Black belt. Jitsu clubs are full of friendly people and we were all beginners once.  We do not have terms so turn up at any session.</p>
    <p>Before you can get on the mat, there is some   paperwork we need to do. This only takes a few minutes to fill in. (Pre-empt the Sensei by downloading the form <a href=" http://www.jitsufoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Licence1718.pdf">here</a>).   If you are under 18 you will need your parents permission. You should have loose comfortable clothing, a t-shirt and jogging   bottoms are ideal. You also need to remove or cover piercings,   jewellery, watches, necklaces. We train barefoot.</p>
    <p>Once the mats are down and everyone is   changed, a senior grade or the Sensei will start the warm-up. This does   exactly what is says on the tin; warm you up. As with all physical   activity, warm muscles and mobile joints work much better in Jitsu. The   motions and exercises of the warm up make sure that we are prepared for   the session. </p>
    <p>There may also be a few traditional exercises   like press-ups or sit-ups. If one of the reasons you are at Jitsu is to   improve your fitness, don't worry! Just do what you are capable of and   let the others do their thing. We know that 10 press-ups can be an   achievement in itself. It's better to do 3 good ones rather than 10   rubbish ones.</p>
    <p>After the warm-up, we line up and rei. This   is a formal greeting to begin the session properly. If it's your first   time, you'll be at the end of the mat nearest the door. Just follow what   the others do as you kneel down. The grade at the head of the line will   command "Sensei, ni-rei!" and you bow to the Sensei. Sensei bows back.</p>
    <p>At this point there is usually some falling   practice and instruction. Jitsu involves lots of being thrown on the   floor, so it's important that we know how to land safely. Although the   essence is simple, this needs quite a bit of practice to become really   proficient. For your first session, either the Sensei or one of the   senior grades will take you to one side, along with any other novices,   to teach you the basics.</p>
    <p>For the rest of the session, the format is   generally that the Sensei will demonstrate a technique and then people   practice in pairs. It will often be broken down into steps; where to   move, how to position, how to apply.</p>
    <p>You may be asked show the rest of the class   what you have just been doing during the session.  Enjoy this and show   off!</p>
    <p> At the   end of the session there is a warm-down, to stretch the muscles we have   been using and reduce any stiffness in the morning. (After your first   session, a warm bath at home is probably a good idea.) After this we   line up again and rei to formally close the session. Then put the mats   away, get changed and go to the Pub.</p>

    <p>Beginners are always welcome and the first   session is free. Just turn up in loose clothing, or contact us if you   have any questions not covered here. Additional information on Junior Jitsu is available from the <a title="Junior Jitsu Foundation" href="http://www.jitsufoundation.org/juniors/">Foundation website</a>. Please note that a parent or guardian must sign the <a title="External Link : Foundation membership form" href="http://www.jitsufoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Licence1718.pdf">membership form</a> before a junior can train.</p>
    <h3>What the Students get:</h3>
    <p><br>
      Jitsu is great fun! As well as being great exercise and a lot of fun, Jitsu   develops many skills and talents that are just as useful off the mat as   on it.<br>
      There are the obvious physical benefits:   fitness, balance, coordination and an excellent understanding of the   body and its capabilities and limitations. But it doesn't stop there.   Jitsu also teaches discipline, respect, consideration and confidence.<br>
    As a Jitsuka (student) develops and progresses in the Art,   they will also have responsibility for teaching others (under   supervision). This grows their social skills and an understanding of the   limitations of the Jitsuka and those around them. Teaching will help   them to understand their own Jitsu better and give them an appreciation   of the differences between their own viewpoint and that of those they   are with.<br>
      It should also be mentioned that Jitsu, like football, rugby,   hockey etc., is a full-contact, physical activity. As mentioned on the   membership form, this does have certain risks. Jitsuka do get hit   occasionally, and they will get bruises, the odd fat lip and maybe a   bloody nose or black eye. It happens to the best of us. However, serious   injuries are rare in Jitsu. All Sensei are qualified first-aiders and   we always train in the safest way possible.</p>
    </p>
<p>
    <h3>What the Parents get :</h3>
    <br>
      Firstly, parents are always welcome at any session. We have nothing to hide and are always happy to discuss any part of the style,   organisation or practices of the Club. Your Jitsuka will be learning from a qualified, insured (by SportsCoach UK, a division of Sport   England) instructor, who is determined to teach in the most effective   manner so that every Jitsuka can achieve the maximum from the Club.</p>
    <p> All   Junior Jitsu Sensei are DBS cleared and constantly have both their own progress and that of the Club monitored by a mentor. The safety and well-being of our Jitsuka is the most important thing to any Sensei.</p>
